                            <ul><li>In case of disconnection from the server, the POS software will prompt the operator to either wait for the server connection to resume or to continue in offline mode. Whilst there are some severe limitations to working in offline mode, it is often a better option than the alternative which is to have your POS terminals inactive until the server connection is reestablished. Whilst in offline mode the POS software will clearly indicate the offline state and continue trying to reconnect in the background. During this time, all sales must be rung up as cash purchases and payment may only be made using cash or EFTPOS (account payments are not available).</li></ul>
