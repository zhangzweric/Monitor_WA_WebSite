	<div class="fleft"><div class="photoblock-many"><a href="img/SW/IDCapture.jpg"><img src="img/SW/snapshot/IDCapture.jpg" alt="IDCapture" /></a></div></div><p>The IDCapture application has been developed by Monitor WA to assist schools and other institutions to place card orders via email. The software maintains a database of students or patrons and when a card order is required it is a simple matter to click a button to order a card for that person and then email the order through to Monitor for processing. Core features include the ability to import patrons from an external third party database and the ability to submit email orders via MAPI or SMTP.<br /><br />Installation of IDCapture is simple but we recommend you contact Monitor WA by phone or email (using the Contacts tab on this web site) to seek assistance if you havenâ€™t installed the program previously.<br /><br />There are several different versions of IDCapture that affect what fields are required for submitting card orders, provide custom integration into third party systems (such as SIS for SmartRider) and the email address to which card orders are sent. Please take care to choose the correct version for your environment, and contact Monitor WA for assistance if you are unsure.<br /><br />Please note that every IDCapture installation requires a site code that must be supplied by Monitor WA and is used to identify your site when card orders are received.<br /><br />For specific information about using IDCapture for SmartRider, please refer to our SmartRider Portal <a href="../smartrider/default.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
