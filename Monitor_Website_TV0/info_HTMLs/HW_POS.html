		<h1>POS Terminals</h1>
        <div class="fleft"><img src="img/HW/POS.jpg"></div><p>Monitor WA has been supplying Senor POS terminals in Western Australia for several years and we are very pleased with the product, having found hardware from Senor to be state-of-the-art, sturdy and reliable.<br /><br />The POS terminal we normally supply is from the ISPOS range which is a fan-less and vent-less all-in-one touch system. This product offers an IP66 rating making it water resistant, dust proof and rust proof allowing it to be used in the harshest of environments. The luxurious, heat dissipating solid aluminum die-cast casing and finishing of the ISPOS is not only visually attractive, but also allows for effortless cleaning in even the dirtiest work zones.<br /><br />For information about POS accessories such as receipt rolls, or to order online, please refer to our POS Accessories page on this web site.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
